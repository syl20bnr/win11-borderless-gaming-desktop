Borderless Gaming Desktop gives your Ultrawide Windows 11 battlestation two
loadouts: a comfortable **Desktop Mode** and a focused **Gaming Mode**. Pick a
Gaming resolution, choose your cleanup actions, and switch with one purple
button. It is portable, needs no installer, and changes nothing just because you
opened it.

### Ready, player one?

1. [Download the latest portable `.exe`](https://github.com/syl20bnr/win11-borderless-gaming-desktop/releases/latest).
2. Put it wherever you like and run it.
3. Choose your Gaming resolution and actions, then press **Activate gaming mode**.

### Pick your loadout

Gaming Mode can:

- switch the primary monitor to your chosen resolution when **Change resolution** is checked
- auto-hide the taskbar
- hide desktop icons
- replace the wallpaper with solid black
- minimize open windows

Every action is optional. Launch the app first at your everyday resolution; that
becomes Desktop Mode. The selected Gaming resolution is remembered even when
**Change resolution** is unchecked, and choosing it does not apply it immediately.
Press **Restore desktop mode** to bring back the captured resolution and
reversible desktop settings. Windows minimized during activation stay minimized.

Your loadout is saved automatically. Sounds, start-at-login behavior, minimized
login launches, and window transparency have their own controls too.

### Two modes. One purple button.

|                | Desktop Mode 🖥️               | Gaming Mode 🎮                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Resolution** | Captured Desktop resolution    | Chosen Gaming resolution      |
| **Taskbar**    | Original setting restored      | Auto-hide when selected       |
| **Desktop**    | Icons and wallpaper restored   | Selected cleanup actions      |
| **Status LED** | Cool gray                      | Bright green                  |

### Stays out of your way

- Closing the window or pressing `Alt+F4` hides the app in the system tray.
- A normal Windows minimize still minimizes to the taskbar.
- Double-clicking the tray icon switches modes.
- Right-clicking it opens the app, switches modes, quits, and shows your loadout.
- Only one instance runs; launching it again brings the existing window forward.

> [!TIP]
> **Quit** closes the app without changing modes. Restore Desktop Mode first if
> you want your everyday setup back.
